      <p className="lead text-justify fs-5">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This "write once, run anywhere" capability has made Java one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>
